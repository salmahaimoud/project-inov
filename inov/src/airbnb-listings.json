    "host_about": "A (relatively) young, energetic person from Cyprus eager for new experiences and to meet new people!!! I live in Edinburgh for almost 5 years now and can confirm that if there is a place to visit in the UK, well drop by and you will never regret it!!! :)\r\n\r\nAs for me; apart from my daily lame routine that involves working from 9 to 5:30 every week day, I tend to go for the occasional run, some cycling and generally, anything that gets me out of the house after work. But what i love and enjoy the most is nothing else but dancing!!! So if you want to dance your night away in Edinburgh, you are more than welcome to my flat!! :)\r\n\r\nI 've used Airbnb before, when i traveled to the US and I loved the idea; I always believed that people are awesome and Airbnb is here to prove that!! :)\r\n\r\nMany thanks and see you soon!!\r\nDemos",

The famous Hollywood Boulevard is only a 3 stop train ride away, about 10min. You can easily take a walk there as well which will take you about 30min. Public transportation is all in walking distance and there are plenty of grocery stores and small food places around. In about 15min walking distance you will be on Vermont Avenue with a lot of nice restaurants and shopping possibilities. One of my favorite stores is the Vintage store Squaresville which is pretty popular for it's amazing selection of Vintage clothing.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The Upper East Side is a great place for museums, parks, restaurants, and bars. The Metropolitan Museum is just a short bus-ride or long walk away and the East River is nearly in eye's view. The neighborhood is a perfect mix of quiet and city-life.",
    "notes": "The apartment is old and newly rented, so it is still a work in progress! Art is being hung every day and a fresh coat of paint is slowly but surely being applied. But the beds are fitted with fresh, comfy linens and all the necessary amenities are here at your disposal! It is also important to note that it is an old New York apartment so at times you can softly hear the neighbors. Plus it is a 6-floor walk-up (but the view at the top is worth it!)",
    "transit": "To get to the West Side, the M79 and the M86 cross-town buses are just a short walk away. If going North or South, you can either take the M15 (express or local) right on 1st Avenue or it's about a ten minute walk to the 4\\5\\6 train.",

    "interaction": "Need help with directions? Suggestions for spots to eat? Want to relax on your own? You let me know and I will accommodate you. I'm happy to help you with whatever you need! Someone will always be there to greet you with keys and show you where all of the amenities are.",
    "house_rules": "Please make yourself at home. I only ask that there is no red wine on the couch and you treat the apartment, the building, and the neighborhood respectfully. Everyone in this area is super helpful and friendly, so if you need anything just ask.",

If you'd like a trivia partner, a guide to walk with you to Five Points, or someone to cook a meal with at home, I'm usually up for it!  At other times guests have gone their entire stay and we've not even seen each other.  I am more than willing to provide advice and recommendations, and you can always get in touch with me if needed.  :)",
    "house_rules": "No smoking in the home at any time.  Also no use of any open flames.  No heating elements except for those already provided or basic bathroom appliances (hair dryer, curling iron, etc). Naturally, we expect basic respect for the home and property.  If any significant damage occurs or excessive cleaning is required we will claim through Airbnb who may pursue offending guests for reimbursement.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The house is a comfortable 1 mile walk across the scenic Shelby Street pedestrian bridge to downtown and less than a mile to Five Points, the heart of the East Nashville business district featuring 3 Crow Bar, The 5 Spot, and Margot Cafe.  Even closer are Sky Blue Cafe for a great local breakfast or good coffee, and The Crying Wolf, a hip new bar with great simple cocktails and amazing burgers.",
    "notes": "We have two tuxedo cats and a puppy, they're very sweet and really not a problem for anyone with MILD allergies since they mostly stay outside or upstairs with me. Also, we allow guests with pets to stay as long as they play nice!  The house is very clean, however probably not the best choice for anyone with severe cat or dog allergies.",
    "transit": "There is a bus stop (MTA route #4) directly outside.  It runs from 1-3 times per hour, depending on the day of the week.  Uber is highly recommended in Nashville.  They are inexpensive and there are drivers close by nearly always.  Be ready to go when you request your ride!",
    "access": "Guests have free use of the first floor of the house as described above.",
    "interaction": "This can vary widely depending on my work schedule and how much interaction you want!  If you'd like a trivia partner, a guide to walk with you to Five Points, or someone to cook a meal with at home, I'm usually up for it!  At other times guests have gone their entire stay and we've not even seen each other.  I am more than willing to provide advice and recommendations, and you can always get in touch with me if needed.  :)",
    "house_rules": "No smoking in the home at any time, outside is fine.  No use of any open flames. No heating elements except for those already provided or basic bathroom appliances (hair dryer, curling iron, etc). Naturally, we expect basic respect for the home and property.  If any significant damage occurs or excessive cleaning is required we will claim through Airbnb who may pursue offending guests for reimbursement.",

But what i love and enjoy the most is nothing else but dancing!!! So if you want to dance your night away in Edinburgh, you are more than welcome to my flat!! :)\r\n\r\nI 've used Airbnb before, when i traveled to the US and I loved the idea; I always believed that people are awesome and Airbnb is here to prove that!! :)\r\n\r\nMany thanks and see you soon!!\r\nDemos",

My multicultural and multilingual parents are avid travelers who, along with my realtives across the pond, showed me a great deal of the world both literally and culturally before I even turned 18. As an adult I carried on the familial wanderlust and have now set foot inside 33 sovereign nations and about a dozen dependant territories. I have also, for a much more significant amout of time, resided in France and Ireland. I hold passports for the four sovereign nation of Canada, UK, Ireland, and Romania. Believe it or not! I am a quadruple citizen.\n\nI sincerely look forward to sharing my love of travel and sharing knowledge with you. My hosting 'style' can definitely be personable and involved. That being said I respect privacy above all else.\n\n This includes with fellow Canadians for whom I hope to be a suitable ambassador to my wonderful birthplace, which has grown into a truly alpha global city; having moved ahead by leaps and bounds since my own 'first visit' in the late 80s.\n\nSo to everyone planning a visit I say in the languages used by members of my own extended family:\n\nWelcome!\nC\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte!\nBienvenue!\nCroeso!\nBine ati venit!\n\nRegards,\n\nAodhan Wolfe Dickson",

    "neighborhood_overview": "There is something so charming about the East Village. It still has that old New York feel, with tenement buildings, small parks (Thompkin Square Park is a block away), historic buildings and classic eateries. There is something for everyone in the east village but it caters to a sort of \"low profile\" person who may be wearing designer one of a kind pieces mixed with awesome vintage finds. Sipping an Abra\u00e7o Cortado on the corner of 7th and 1st Ave.  So if fine dinning, speak easy bars, eclectic cuisine, Turkish bath houses (there is one across the street), Pilates/yoga in classic 1890's style buildings is up your alley then come stay in the East Village. Plus you'll be walking distance to all things Posh in SoHo, all things Quaint in the West Village, all things indie in the Lower East Side, all things Italian in little Italy and all things Asian in Chinatown. You'll have it all at your finger tips! Enjoy!",
    "notes": "Please please please do not loose the keys. They cost a lot of money to replace because they can only be duplicated by one company and because they have a special fob on them which is also considerably expensive. Thank you!",
    "transit": "4 blocks from the L train (two stops from Union Square with connects to just about every train in Manhattan), few blocks away from the 6 Train, 10 blocks from the F train.  And walking distance to all the amazing wonders of Downtown Manhattan!",

    "host_about": "I moved from Los Angeles to New York and worked in the fashion industry for 3 amazing years.  After a fabulous and exhausting time I decided to take off to Thailand to Study Yoga, my true passion.  I had been practicing for 7 years and it was in Thailand that I recieved my 200 hour Yoga Instructor Certification! I'm more proud of this 2 month intensive study than my entire college education at UCSB.  After thailand I traveled to Lao, England, Scottland, Wales, Ireland, Neitherlands, and Spain before flying to Switzerland to take a chance on love and visit the one man I shared a flirtatious evening with in the north of Thailand.  A few days turned into 3 months and now I live between Los Angeles, New York and Switzerland teaching yoga and sharing my love of travel, yoga, and the whimsical idea that love CAN/DOES happen anywhere/everywhere.  Hope you will enjoy my apartment as much as I did while I was in NYC!  I have an excellent team helping me maintain the apartment and if you need anything I am always here for you! Namaste! And all the Best! Rachel",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Our cottage is in (we think!) the perfect location to enjoy all that Santa Cruz has to offer - we're only blocks from downtown, the boardwalk, the wharf, and Cowell's beach.  You can walk to the beach for coffee and breakfast at the Picnic Basket in the morning, bask in the sun on the deck in the cottage in the afternoon, and then walk downtown for dinner at night. Also, the walking path and pontoon path in Neary Lagoon is a hidden treasure, with all sorts of beautiful wildlife.",
    "notes": "Like many other popular rentals, we have been contacted by the city to collect a transient occupancy tax of 11% of the total cost (before AirBNB fees). I'm sure all rentals will be collecting this very soon (all hotels currently collect it) - help us in being compliant with the law :).  The tax is included in the price and breaks down as follows: Summer weekday price: (phone number hidden) Summer weekend price: (phone number hidden) Winter weekday price:(phone number hidden) Winter weekend price: (phone number hidden) Cleaning fee: 30 + 11% = 33 Each additional person per night over 2 people: 10 + 11% = 11 We are very pleased to share our living space with you.  Occasionally, our very friendly medium-sized dog, Kona, pays a visit and roams the yard.  Please be sure you are comfortable with this! Two night minimum if staying Saturday night (i.e. Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday).",

My multicultural and multilingual parents are avid travelers who, along with my realtives across the pond, showed me a great deal of the world both literally and culturally before I even turned 18. As an adult I carried on the familial wanderlust and have now set foot inside 33 sovereign nations and about a dozen dependant territories. I have also, for a much more significant amout of time, resided in France and Ireland. I hold passports for the four sovereign nation of Canada, UK, Ireland, and Romania. Believe it or not! I am a quadruple citizen.\n\nI sincerely look forward to sharing my love of travel and sharing knowledge with you. My hosting 'style' can definitely be personable and involved. That being said I respect privacy above all else.\n\n This includes with fellow Canadians for whom I hope to be a suitable ambassador to my wonderful birthplace, which has grown into a truly alpha global city; having moved ahead by leaps and bounds since my own 'first visit' in the late 80s.\n\nSo to everyone planning a visit I say in the languages used by members of my own extended family:\n\nWelcome!\nC\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte!\nBienvenue!\nCroeso!\nBine ati venit!\n\nRegards,\n\nAodhan Wolfe Dickson",
