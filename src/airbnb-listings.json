I live in Edinburgh for almost 5 years now and can confirm that if there is a place to visit in the UK, well drop by and you will never regret it!!! :)\r\n\r\nAs for me; apart from my daily lame routine that involves working from 9 to 5:30 every week day, I tend to go for the occasional run, some cycling and generally, anything that gets me out of the house after work. But what i love and enjoy the most is nothing else but dancing!!! So if you want to dance your night away in Edinburgh, you are more than welcome to my flat!! :)\r\n\r\nI 've used Airbnb before, when i traveled to the US and I loved the idea; I always believed that people are awesome and Airbnb is here to prove that!! :)\r\n\r\nMany thanks and see you soon!!\r\nDemos",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The Upper East Side is a great place for museums, parks, restaurants, and bars. The Metropolitan Museum is just a short bus-ride or long walk away and the East River is nearly in eye's view. The neighborhood is a perfect mix of quiet and city-life.",
    "notes": "The apartment is old and newly rented, so it is still a work in progress! Art is being hung every day and a fresh coat of paint is slowly but surely being applied. But the beds are fitted with fresh, comfy linens and all the necessary amenities are here at your disposal! It is also important to note that it is an old New York apartment so at times you can softly hear the neighbors. Plus it is a 6-floor walk-up (but the view at the top is worth it!)",
    "transit": "To get to the West Side, the M79 and the M86 cross-town buses are just a short walk away. If going North or South, you can either take the M15 (express or local) right on 1st Avenue or it's about a ten minute walk to the 4\\5\\6 train.",

    "interaction": "Need help with directions? Suggestions for spots to eat? Want to relax on your own? You let me know and I will accommodate you. I'm happy to help you with whatever you need! Someone will always be there to greet you with keys and show you where all of the amenities are.",

But the beds are fitted with fresh, comfy linens and all the necessary amenities are here at your disposal! It is also important to note that it is an old New York apartment so at times you can softly hear the neighbors. Plus it is a 6-floor walk-up (but the view at the top is worth it!)",
    "transit": "To get to the West Side, the M79 and the M86 cross-town buses are just a short walk away. If going North or South, you can either take the M15 (express or local) right on 1st Avenue or it's about a ten minute walk to the 4\\5\\6 train.",

    "interaction": "This can vary widely depending on my work schedule and how much interaction you want!  If you'd like a trivia partner, a guide to walk with you to Five Points, or someone to cook a meal with at home, I'm usually up for it!  At other times guests have gone their entire stay and we've not even seen each other.  I am more than willing to provide advice and recommendations, and you can always get in touch with me if needed.  :)",
    "house_rules": "No smoking in the home at any time, outside is fine.  No use of any open flames. No heating elements except for those already provided or basic bathroom appliances (hair dryer, curling iron, etc). Naturally, we expect basic respect for the home and property.  If any significant damage occurs or excessive cleaning is required we will claim through Airbnb who may pursue offending guests for reimbursement.",

But what i love and enjoy the most is nothing else but dancing!!! So if you want to dance your night away in Edinburgh, you are more than welcome to my flat!! :)\r\n\r\nI 've used Airbnb before, when i traveled to the US and I loved the idea; I always believed that people are awesome and Airbnb is here to prove that!! :)\r\n\r\nMany thanks and see you soon!!\r\nDemos",

    "host_about": "I am a first-generation Canadian born and raised in downtown Toronto. My multicultural and multilingual parents are avid travelers who, along with my realtives across the pond, showed me a great deal of the world both literally and culturally before I even turned 18. As an adult I carried on the familial wanderlust and have now set foot inside 33 sovereign nations and about a dozen dependant territories. I have also, for a much more significant amout of time, resided in France and Ireland. I hold passports for the four sovereign nation of Canada, UK, Ireland, and Romania. Believe it or not! I am a quadruple citizen.\n\nI sincerely look forward to sharing my love of travel and sharing knowledge with you. My hosting 'style' can definitely be personable and involved. That being said I respect privacy above all else.\n\n This includes with fellow Canadians for whom I hope to be a suitable ambassador to my wonderful birthplace, which has grown into a truly alpha global city; having moved ahead by leaps and bounds since my own 'first visit' in the late 80s.\n\nSo to everyone planning a visit I say in the languages used by members of my own extended family:\n\nWelcome!\nC\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte!\nBienvenue!\nCroeso!\nBine ati venit!\n\nRegards,\n\nAodhan Wolfe Dickson",

It still has that old New York feel, with tenement buildings, small parks (Thompkin Square Park is a block away), historic buildings and classic eateries.

Sipping an Abra\u00e7o Cortado on the corner of 7th and 1st Ave.  So if fine dinning, speak easy bars, eclectic cuisine, Turkish bath houses (there is one across the street), Pilates/yoga in classic 1890's style buildings is up your alley then come stay in the East Village. Plus you'll be walking distance to all things Posh in SoHo, all things Quaint in the West Village, all things indie in the Lower East Side, all things Italian in little Italy and all things Asian in Chinatown. You'll have it all at your finger tips! Enjoy!",

After a fabulous and exhausting time I decided to take off to Thailand to Study Yoga, my true passion.  I had been practicing for 7 years and it was in Thailand that I recieved my 200 hour Yoga Instructor Certification! I'm more proud of this 2 month intensive study than my entire college education at UCSB.  After thailand I traveled to Lao, England, Scottland, Wales, Ireland, Neitherlands, and Spain before flying to Switzerland to take a chance on love and visit the one man I shared a flirtatious evening with in the north of Thailand.  A few days turned into 3 months and now I live between Los Angeles, New York and Switzerland teaching yoga and sharing my love of travel, yoga, and the whimsical idea that love CAN/DOES happen anywhere/everywhere.  Hope you will enjoy my apartment as much as I did while I was in NYC!  I have an excellent team helping me maintain the apartment and if you need anything I am always here for you! Namaste! And all the Best! Rachel",

You can walk to the beach for coffee and breakfast at the Picnic Basket in the morning, bask in the sun on the deck in the cottage in the afternoon, and then walk downtown for dinner at night. Also, the walking path and pontoon path in Neary Lagoon is a hidden treasure, with all sorts of beautiful wildlife.",

I'm sure all rentals will be collecting this very soon (all hotels currently collect it) - help us in being compliant with the law :).  The tax is included in the price and breaks down as follows: Summer weekday price: (phone number hidden) Summer weekend price: (phone number hidden) Winter weekday price:(phone number hidden) Winter weekend price: (phone number hidden) Cleaning fee: 30 + 11% = 33 Each additional person per night over 2 people: 10 + 11% = 11 We are very pleased to share our living space with you.  Occasionally, our very friendly medium-sized dog, Kona, pays a visit and roams the yard.  Please be sure you are comfortable with this! Two night minimum if staying Saturday night (i.e. Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday).",

I have also, for a much more significant amout of time, resided in France and Ireland. I hold passports for the four sovereign nation of Canada, UK, Ireland, and Romania. Believe it or not! I am a quadruple citizen.\n\nI sincerely look forward to sharing my love of travel and sharing knowledge with you. My hosting 'style' can definitely be personable and involved. That being said I respect privacy above all else.\n\n This includes with fellow Canadians for whom I hope to be a suitable ambassador to my wonderful birthplace, which has grown into a truly alpha global city; having moved ahead by leaps and bounds since my own 'first visit' in the late 80s.\n\nSo to everyone planning a visit I say in the languages used by members of my own extended family:\n\nWelcome!\nC\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte!\nBienvenue!\nCroeso!\nBine ati venit!\n\nRegards,\n\nAodhan Wolfe Dickson",
